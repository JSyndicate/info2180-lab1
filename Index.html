            <p>My name is Jevan Williamson. I am a student of the University of the West Indeies. I am currently in my second year and first semester persuing my Bachelors Degree. My major is Computer Science. Web Development is an interesting course. It allows you to learn about the web and among other things and what you can do with it. It allows you to take such a basic and simple idea and turn it into one of the worlds greatest platforms like a Business Plan or if you are being creative for your personal benefit a marriage proposal or something like that to your girlfriend/boyfriend/partner. Web Development offers a lot of options and gateways to chose from its just for the person who is learning about it to know what he or she wants. Life isn't easy at all but we still got to LIVE LOVE LAUGH and move forward.</p>
